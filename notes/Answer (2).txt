When you separate your database connection code into a separate file (such as connector.js), you'll need to import and execute that file from your main application file (main.js). Let's walk through the steps:
- Create Your Connector File (connector.js):
    - In your project directory, create a new file named connector.js.
    - Inside connector.js, write your MySQL connection code (similar to what you had in main.js).
- Export the Connection Object:
    - In connector.js, export the MySQL connection object so that you can use it in other files.
    - Example connector.js content:

// connector.js
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root',
    password: null, // or your actual password
    database: 'your-database-name'
});

module.exports = connection;

- Import and Use in main.js:
    - In your main.js (or wherever you need to use the database connection), import the exported connection object from connector.js.
    - Example main.js content:

const connection = require('./connector'); // Assuming connector.js is in the same directory

// Now you can use the 'connection' object for queries, etc.
connection.connect(function(err) {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error connecting to MySQL:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('Connected to MySQL database!');
});

// Perform your queries, etc.
// ...

// Don't forget to close the connection when done:
connection.end(function(err) {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error closing MySQL connection:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('MySQL connection closed.');
});

- Run Your Electron Application:
    - Start your Electron application using the command you've set up in your package.json (usually npm start).
    - The connector.js code will be executed along with your main application code.
Remember to replace 'localhost', 'root', null, and 'your-database-name' with your actual database credentials. By following this approach, you'll keep your code organized and maintainable! ðŸŒŸ  .
Feel free to adapt this structure based on your project's needs and preferences.
